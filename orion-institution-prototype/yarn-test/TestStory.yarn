This is a test script for yarn spinner.
This will show how working with yarn is done, and make sure everything is working in the project correctly.

Here's some dialogue options
-> This is one dialogue option
    This is the text that displays when you select this option
-> This is another
    Now you'll never know what happened if you picked the first option

If that worked correctly, you should see this no matter what now.

This is another test, to see how jumping to other nodes work;
-> Get the name of a colour
    <<jump Colour>>
-> Get the name of an animal
    <<jump Animal>>

If that worked correctly, you shouldn't be seeing this line.
