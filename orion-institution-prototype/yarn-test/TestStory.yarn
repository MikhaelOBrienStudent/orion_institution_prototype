Arden:This is a test script for yarn spinner.
Arden:This will show how working with yarn is done, and make sure everything is working in the project correctly.

Arden:Here's some dialogue options
-> This is one dialogue option
    This is the text that displays when you select this option
-> This is another
    Now you'll never know what happened if you picked the first option

Arden:If that worked correctly, you should see this no matter what now.

Arden:This is another test, to see how jumping to other nodes work;
-> Get the name of a colour
    <<jump Colour>>
-> Get the name of an animal
    <<jump Animal>>

If that worked correctly, you shouldn't be seeing this line.
